# arrays-lab

Welcome to the JavaScript Arrays lab, in this lab you will practice how to create arrays and how to add and delete elements within the array.

Instructions:
Objective: You will use arrays to plan the crops to be planted on the farm for each season and apply array methods to manage the crop data.

Activity Description:

Crop Planning Arrays Setup:
Initialize four arrays: springCrops, summerCrops, autumnCrops, and winterCrops.
Populate each array with crop names relevant to the respective season, e.g., ['carrots', 'lettuce', 'radishes'] for spring.
Applying Array Methods:
- Use array methods to add 4 different crops the end of the summerCrops Array.
- Use array methods to add 3 different crops the beginning of the springCrops Array.
- Use array methods to remove 2 different crops from the end of the autumnCrops Array.
- Use array methods to remove 1 crop from the beginning of the winterCrops array.
- Use array methods to print the legnth of the final array.

Display Crop Plans:
Use console.log() to display each season's crop plan.
