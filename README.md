# arrays-lab

# Welcome to the JavaScript Arrays lab, in this lab you will practice how to create arrays and how to add and delete elements within the array.

# Activity One:

## Objective: You will use arrays to plan the crops to be planted on the farm for each season and apply array methods to manage the crop data.

## Activity Description:

## Crop Planning Arrays Setup:
Initialize four arrays: springCrops, summerCrops, autumnCrops, and winterCrops.
Populate each array with crop names relevant to the respective season, e.g., ```let springCrops = ['carrots', 'lettuce', 'radishes'];``` for spring


## Applying Array Methods:
- Use array methods to add 4 different crops at the end of the summerCrops Array.
- Use array methods to add 3 different crops at the beginning of the springCrops Array.
- Use array methods to remove 2 different crops from the end of the autumnCrops Array.
- Use array methods to remove 1 crop from the beginning of the winterCrops array.
- Use array methods to print the length of the final array.

## Display Crop Plans:
Use console.log() to display each season's crop plan.



# Activity Two:

## Objective: You will simulate the harvesting of crops using 'for' loops.

## Activity Description:

## Harvesting Simulation Setup:
Initialize an empty array called 'harvest' to store harvested crops.

## For Loop Harvesting:
Use a for loop to iterate through each season's crop array.
For each crop in the array, add it to the harvest array.

## Function to Log Harvest:
- Create a function called 'logHarvest' that takes the harvested crops as a parameter.
- Inside the function, loop through the 'harvest' array and log the message "The crops of the [season] is: [harvested crops]".
